# CMSC203 Lab 4: Two-Dimensional Array Practice with GUI Animation

## Overview
This lab explores the use of two-dimensional arrays in Java, integrated with a custom GUI for visualizing array operations. Students implement core array-processing methods and observe their behavior through animated feedback.

## Files Included
- `TwoDimArrayPractice.java`: Contains the logic for array manipulation, including:
  - `fillValues()`: Populates the array with random integers between 50 and 80
  - `setValues(int value, int row)`: Sets all values in a specified row to a given number
  - `findMinimum(int column)`: Finds and returns the minimum value in a specified column
  - `countFound(int value)`: Counts how many times a given value appears in the array
  - `printArray()`: Prints the array to the console with animation

- `BarChart.java`: Provides the GUI interface and animation methods for visualizing array operations.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Rebuild the project: `Build → Rebuild Project`
3. Run `BarChart.java` to launch the GUI
4. Use the buttons to test each method interactively
